create2dclean(record, config, freq = 1, nchunks = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{record}{ccRecord}

\item{config}{the full path of the YAML configuration file}

\item{freq}{table cadence}

\item{nchunks}{integer number. The larger the nchunks the less memory
requirement.}
}
\value{
A cleaned 2d wide table
}
\description{
The cleaning process is specified by the YAML configuration. All the filters
presented in the configuration will be applied. It returns only the cleaned
data. However all the data quality information will be lost. This function
is useful when the memory is not sufficiently enough to hold all the
information.
